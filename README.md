# RabbitMQ on Dotcloud

## Introduction
To run RabbitMQ on dotcloud use the following three commands.

    git clone git://github.com/knowsis/rabbitmq-on-dotcloud.git

    dotcloud create rabbitmq

    dotcloud push


This will create a single custom instance on dotcloud that runs the RabbitMQ server as well as the managment interface.


### Management Interface

The management interface will be made available at:

    http://rabbitmq-<your_dotcloud_username>.dotcloud.com


The build script creates a default user called `rabbitmq` with a password that is autogenerated as part of the build. You can see this password in the build logs or you can retrieve it using the following command if you missed it in the build output:

    dotcloud run server less password


### Memory Requirements

RabbitMQ is set with a default hightide mark for memory of 32M you can adjust this by setting an environment variable called RABBITMQ_HIGHWATERMARK

    dotcloud env set RABBITMQ_HIGHWATERMARK=128


### Limitations

At the moment it is not possible to scale RabbitMQ using the dotcloud `scale` command.
